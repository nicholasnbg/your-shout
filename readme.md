# Your Shout
Your shout is a app that allows you to keep track of how much different individuals within a group are owed/owe money to the rest of the group.

## What does it do?
### With Your Shout you can:
* Create an account the keep track of the different groups your need to keep track of.
* Create groups and add other members to the group
* Add transactions and payments within the group, in a variety of different currencies.
* See who has paid for more than others
and most importantly...
* Who needs to get the next round of beers!

## Technologies used
Your Shout was devloped using the MERN stack:
* MongoDB
* Express 
* React/Redux
* Node.js

## Status
Your Shout is still under development. I have created a preliminary RESTful API, and am currently fleshing out the UI using React and bootstrap v4 (css, not using any component libraries).

## My code
* If you are interested in my Node / Express / MongoDB code, please explore the models, routes, and validation folders in the root folder.
* If you would like to check out my use of React and Redux, please look around inside the client/src folder.


## Try it out
If you would like to run/test/develop Your-Shout, you will need to create a MongoDB database, I used mlab (free), a user for that database, and create a .env file in the root directory exporting your database user name and password.

TODO: Show example .env file structure

Once you have done this, please run npm-init in both the root folder, and the client folder.

Then you can run npm run dev from the root folder to spin up both backend and front end servers.

Please shoot me a message if you have any questions!
